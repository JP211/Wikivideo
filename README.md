# Wikivideo
Wikivideo was created by a team of four developers in order to add video to article searches. Both the Youtube and Wikipedia APIs were used in order to create a more visual experience when searching for articles on a specific topic - the top trending videos for each search are displayed along with any relevent information from wikipedia.
